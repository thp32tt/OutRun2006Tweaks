## Graphics
- DDS inventory/visual review: **243/243 (100%)**

- package: `OutRun2_Korean_GFX_FULL_DRAFT_Test.zip`
- package SHA-256: `5512dad798a4ddb4872e4aa3e69438537f75f488f439317d7b95c0eb372b6c78`
- report: `localization/graphics/FULL_DRAFT_REPORT.json`

The full draft intentionally uses exact/OCR/manual/atlas-alpha placement evidence. Large atlases require screenshot validation before release promotion.

### Graphics QA reset
- Mandatory policy: `localization/graphics/ORIENTATION_POLICY.md`
- Original game DDS from the original analysis archive is the source of truth.
- Previous generated draft art must not be used to infer orientation.
- Per-sprite mirror/rotation must match the original raw DDS.
- Vehicle/model/brand/song/legal artwork is preserve-original unless explicitly approved.
- `841E796B_512x128.dds`: vehicle/model cards preserved as original; do not translate vehicle/model names.
- `EBEF6D20_512x512.dds`: Korean route/loading text must inherit the original raw DDS transforms.
- 1st/2nd/early-3rd batch generated images are visual drafts pending source-faithful rework.

### Source-faithful batches
- Batch16v5: `560FA536` promoted after full containment + manual style/artifact QA, report `BATCH16V5_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Batch17v3: `37759842` rejected; residual English/card-gradient restoration seams remain, report `BATCH17V3_REJECTED_REPORT.json`
- Batch12v2: 4 DXT5 candidates promoted after source-alpha-bounds/header/dimension QA, report `BATCH12V2_DXT5_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Batch3: 10 assets, report `BATCH3_SOURCEFAITHFUL_REPORT.json`
- Batch4: 5 assets, report `BATCH4_SOURCEFAITHFUL_REPORT.json`
- Batch5: 5 assets, report `BATCH5_SOURCEFAITHFUL_REPORT.json`
- Batch6: 12 reviewed, report `BATCH6_SOURCEFAITHFUL_REPORT.json`
- Batch7: style/artifact QA reset, report `BATCH7_STYLE_ARTIFACT_QA_REPORT.json`
- Batch8Fix: 3 rebuilt, report `BATCH8FIX_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Batch9: 3 rebuilt, report `BATCH9_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Batch10v2: 3 retained + 1 reset, report `BATCH10V2_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Batch11v2: 1 retained + 1 reset, report `BATCH11V2_REWORK_REPORT.json`
- Current machine state: `localization/graphics/SOURCE_FAITHFUL_CURRENT.json`
- Source-faithful reviewed since QA reset: **32**
- Retained/rebuilt localized candidates: **27**
- Reset to original pending safe rework: **5**
- Current combined package: `OutRun2_Korean_GFX_SourceFaithful_Combined_B3-B16v5_QA_Test.zip`
- Combined package SHA-256: `b04ee2a5d428ab90163f8207a20ce209d073f73ecfc6f2ebfbdbd62f2ea3b746`
- Mandatory extra QA gates: source-like typography/colors; no stray black lines, crop seams, text-erasure residue, clipped glyphs, accidental opaque boxes, or alpha halos.
- DXT5-safe rewrite still required for several assets, including `49BB5FE5_128x32.dds`, `42E618FD_512x32.dds`, `7CE1CFC5_512x128.dds`, and `C598919A_1024x1024.dds`.

## Runtime/font
- K0 txet roundtrip: **PASS**
- K1 clean trace package: **ready**
- K2 ASCII resolver proof: **ready**
- K3 trace build/package: **ready**
- unique Hangul syllables: **505**
- two-page 1024x1024 Hangul atlas proof: **ready**
- final Hangul runtime render: **pending in-game proof**

## Resume
Read:
1. `localization/progress/progress.json`
2. `localization/resume_state.json`
3. `localization/WORKLOG.md`
4. `localization/graphics/ORIENTATION_POLICY.md`
5. `localization/graphics/SOURCE_FAITHFUL_CURRENT.json`
6. `localization/graphics/BATCH10V2_REWORK_REPORT.json`
7. `localization/graphics/BATCH11V2_REWORK_REPORT.json`
8. `localization/graphics/FULL_DRAFT_REPORT.json`

Next gate: continue the 10 pending assets from original DDS first; solve DXT5-safe rewriting; keep preserve-original names/artwork untouched; run in-game validation on the 22 retained candidates.

### QA checkpoint 2026-09-26 07:05 KST
- Repository state re-read before promotion; no unrepeatable local B12-B15 binary candidate was promoted.
- Hard gate: Korean replacement pixels must remain inside the original text region/sprite cell; clipping, overlap, or spill is rejected.
- Canonical state remains **22 retained / 10 pending**.

// VR settings live here, but the final camera transform does not.
// Head tracking is applied only at the verified D3D9 c64 WorldViewProjection
// upload. Simulation, input, timers and native FFB are never replayed for the
// second eye. Pose.v3 is primary with v2 retained as automatic compatibility
// fallback while frame transport migration is still in progress.
//
// PreferD3D9Ex remains experimental. OutRun/Tweaks uses classic
// D3DPOOL_MANAGED semantics, so the Ex path translates legacy resources and
// must still prove lock/update behavior on real drivers. The current R13 path
// is not literal zero-copy: shared D3D9Ex eyes are copied on the GPU into
// host-owned D3D11 safety textures before the producer slot is acknowledged.
// Classic D3D9 therefore remains the default compatibility path.

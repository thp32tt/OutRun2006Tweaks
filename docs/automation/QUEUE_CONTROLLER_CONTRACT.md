# Queue Controller Automation Contract

This branch is managed by the ChatGPT queue controller.

## Required task record
Every controller-issued task has a TASK_ID. The result commit message MUST include:
`[AUTO:<TASK_ID>]`

Each task must update or add a durable record under `docs/automation/runs/` containing:
- task_id
- target_branch
- base_sha
- result_sha
- automation_validation: PENDING | PASS | FAIL
- runtime_validation: UNTESTED | PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED_RUNTIME
- summary
- evidence
- attempt

## Validation semantics
- Automatic validation and runtime/in-game validation are separate.
- CI success means AUTOMATION_VALIDATION=PASS only.
- If no real HMD/game test was performed, runtime_validation MUST remain UNTESTED.
- Do not claim visual, HMD, GPU synchronization, in-game clipping, or crash-free runtime behavior without actual runtime evidence.
- Runtime-untested work may continue when the next task is independent.
- Runtime-dependent follow-up work must be marked BLOCKED_RUNTIME and skipped in favor of another runnable task.

## Validation-bearing result identity
- A task may have intermediate implementation commits and later bookkeeping/checkpoint commits. The commit that owns the required GitHub Actions Gate MUST be recorded as `validation_bearing_result_sha`; controller validation decisions MUST be made against that exact SHA, not merely the first or latest run observed for the branch.
- Later bookkeeping/checkpoint commits may use CI-skip directives only after the validation-bearing result has completed its required Gate. They MUST preserve the validated `validation_bearing_result_sha` in the durable task record.
- Branch-scoped workflows may intentionally use `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true`. A `cancelled` run for an older/intermediate SHA that was superseded by a newer push is `SUPERSEDED`, not `AUTOMATION_VALIDATION=FAIL`, and MUST NOT consume a repair attempt by itself.
- Before treating a cancelled Gate as a task failure, the controller MUST inspect the run's `head_sha`, current branch HEAD, the durable `validation_bearing_result_sha`, and any newer Gate run for that validation-bearing SHA. If the exact validation-bearing SHA has a later successful Gate, record PASS and retain the successful run as canonical evidence.
- A cancelled Gate on the current validation-bearing SHA with no superseding commit/run remains unresolved and requires direct inspection; cancellation must never be silently converted to PASS.

## Scope
- One modifying task at a time per controller.
- Keep changes narrowly scoped.
- Maximum automatic repair attempts: 3.
- After 3 failed attempts, record the blocker and move to another independent runnable task.
- Never use N100 local clones/worktrees as a project workspace.
- GitHub branch HEAD and Actions are the durable source of truth.
